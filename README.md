:artificial_satellite: Since no one wants to have to remember how to setup their computer again

This repo (like all repos named this way) host my configuration files and way to
quickly setup them up so that when I get a new computer environment, I can clone this repo, and be
off to the races (and then separately install a bunch of apps afterwards I guess). However, I'm
using python for everything because to hell with bash.

The process should be that I can just run `./bootstrap.py` and that's it. I should be able to run
this as many times as I want and not suffer a corrupted system.
