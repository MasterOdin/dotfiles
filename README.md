:artificial_satellite: Since no one wants to have to remember how to setup their computer again

This repo helps to hold my configuration files for my computers so that I can easily
replicate it across to a new machine. Probably not useful to be run by others.

Files are symlinked to the appropriate place as much as possible to make committing
back into this repo as easy as possible.

Currently setup to work for:

* macOS

## Usage

```bash
./bootstrap.sh
```
